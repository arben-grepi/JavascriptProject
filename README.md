*About the tool:*

The tool is designed for teachers to efficiently divide a list of students in an Excel sheet into groups based on user-selected criteria. It is particularly useful for creating small groups for project work. The tool allows users to form groups based on specific criteria (such as student class), while also ensuring diversity in desired project roles within each group.
